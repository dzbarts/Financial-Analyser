The rule of all strategies: the longer the period taken for a certain strategy, the lower the risk.

1. SMA (Simple Moving Average).
It identifies the main trends as transparently as possible,
as well as collateral price changes.

Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving line from top to bottom.
Otherwise, buy.


2.twoSMA is also a simple moving average,
however, prices are taken as a fast moving average instead of an average.
Also indicates major trends and collateral price changes.
For a fast moving one, the value is taken up to half of the slow one.

Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving one from top to bottom,
it's worth selling. Otherwise, buy.


3. EMA (Exponential Moving Average) - a type of moving average,
calculated exponentially. Compared to simple,
exponent gives much more importance to current values than old ones.

Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving one from top to bottom,
it's worth selling. Otherwise, buy.


4. DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average) - twice taken EMA,
is more advanced than traditional moving averages.

Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving one from top to bottom,
it's worth selling. Otherwise, buy.


5. TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average) - three times taken EMA,
responds faster, which makes it more in demand among traders.

Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving one from top to bottom,
it's worth selling. Otherwise, buy.


6. MACD (Moving Average Convergence / Divergence) - Moving Average Convergence / Divergence.

Strategy: if the histogram crosses the signal line from top to bottom,
it's worth selling. Otherwise, buy.


7. CHV volatility indicator (Chaikin Volatility) - an indicator,
with which the volatility of the market is determined.

Strategy: the beginning of the indicator may indicate
about the formation of the next high of the price. In this case, volatility
will increase until this extremum is set.
Rapid decline in the CHV curve.
Probably in the near future there is a strong correction or pullback in the price.


8. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - overbought / oversold index.
Oscillator (a special indicator that predicts market or stock trends)
is calculated based on the closing prices and shows
who is currently dominating the market: bulls (buyers) or bears (sellers).

Strategy: Returns values between 0 and 100,
that values below 30 indicate an undervaluation of the market (you need to buy),
and above 70 - about overbought (you need to sell).


8. Bulls Power indicator is a simple and effective analysis tool,
the use of which allows you to determine the mood of buyers ("bulls")
in the indicated period of time.

Strategy: if the bars of the histogram are growing,
but the values are still less than 0, then it is worth buying;
if the bars of the histogram are falling, but the values are still greater than 0,
it's worth selling.


9. Bears Power indicator is a classic oscillator,
determining the strength of the sellers ("bears") of the market in the selected time period.

Strategy: if the bars of the histogram are growing,
but the values are still less than 0, then it is worth buying;
if the bars of the histogram are falling, but the values are still greater than 0,
it's worth selling.


10. ER (Elder Rays) indicator is a complex indicator.
The price is determined by a compromise between buyers and sellers.

Strategy: if the bars of the histogram are growing,
but the values are still less than 0, then it is worth buying;
if the bars of the histogram are falling, but the values are still greater than 0,
it's worth selling.

11. Indicator MI (Mass Index) - a technical indicator,
the use of which makes it possible to predict a trend reversal
by analyzing the dynamics of changes in the price range.

Strategy: if the curve crosses line 27 from bottom to top,
and then the line 26.5 from top to bottom, then you should buy.
