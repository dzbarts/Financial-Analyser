The rule of all strategies: the longer the period taken for a certain strategy, the lower the risk.
1. SMA (Simple Moving Average) is a simple moving average.
It indicates the main trends as transparently as possible, as
well as side price changes.
Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving from top to bottom, then it is worth selling.
In the opposite case, buy.

2. twoSMA is also a simple moving average,
but a fast moving average is taken instead of the price.
It also indicates the main trends and side price changes.
For a fast moving average, a value of up to half of the slow one is taken.
Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving from top to bottom,
then it is worth selling. In the opposite case, buy.

3. EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is a kind of moving average
calculated exponentially. In comparison with the simple one, the
exponent attaches much more importance to the current values than to the old ones.
Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving from top to bottom,
then it is worth selling. In the opposite case, buy.

4. DEMA (Double exponential moving average) – twice taken EMA,
it is more advanced than traditional moving averages.
Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving from top to bottom,
then it is worth selling. In the opposite case, buy.

5. TEMA (Triple exponential moving average - the EMA taken three times
reacts faster, which makes it more in demand among traders.
Strategy: if the price crosses the slow moving from top to bottom,
then it is worth selling. In the opposite case, buy.

6. MACD (Moving average convergence/divergence) – convergence/divergence of moving averages.
Strategy: if the histogram crosses the signal line from top to bottom,
then it is worth selling. In the opposite case, buy.

7. The volatility indicator CHV (Chaikin Volatility) is an indicator
used to determine the volatility of the market.
Strategy: the beginning of the growth of the indicator may indicate
the formation of another price maximum. In this case, volatility
will increase until this extreme is established.
The rapid decline of the CHV curve indicates a slowdown in the current trend.
There is likely to be a strong correction or pullback in the price in the near future.

8. RSI (Relative strength index) – overbought/oversold index.
An oscillator (a special indicator that predicts market or stock trends) is
calculated based on closing prices and shows
who is currently dominating the market: bulls (buyers) or bears (sellers).
Strategy: the indicator returns values from 0 to 100, it
is believed that values below 30 indicate that the market is undervalued (you need to buy)
and above 70 - overbought (you need to sell).

8. Bulls Power indicator is a simple and effective analysis tool,
the use of which allows you to determine the mood of buyers ("bulls")
in a designated period of time.
Strategy: if the histogram columns are growing,
but the values are still less than 0, then it is worth buying;
if the histogram columns are falling, but the values are still greater than 0,
it's worth selling.

9. The Bears Power indicator is a classic oscillator that
determines the strength of sellers ("bears") of the market in the selected time period.
Strategy: if the histogram columns are growing,
but the values are still less than 0, then it is worth buying;
if the histogram columns are falling, but the values are still greater than 0,
it's worth selling.

10. The ER (Elder Rays) indicator is a complex indicator.
The price is determined as a result of a compromise between buyers and sellers.
Strategy: if the histogram columns are growing,
but the values are still less than 0, then it is worth buying;
if the histogram columns are falling, but the values are still greater than 0,
it's worth selling.

11. The MI indicator (Mass Index) is a technical indicator, the
use of which makes it possible to predict a trend reversal
by analyzing the dynamics of changes in the price range.
Strategy: if the curve crosses line 27 from bottom to top,
and then the line 26.5 from top to bottom, then you should buy.
